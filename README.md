# Citrus Townhall (Bot)

Citrus Townhall is a bot that encourages server activity, with features such as:
* XP
* Events
* Jobs
* Collectables
And so much more!

## XP
You gain XP by chatting and working! The more you have, the more perks the server owner might give you :OOO

## Events
Events can be hosted by anyone! It can be about anything, from gaming to drawing, whatever you can think about :D
Each event costs currency to host, though participants need to pay to join too! It is an investment to make, but if you have many participants, you can gain much money ^^
How about participants? It costs nothing to join, and the bot even rewards you with an event trophy (more on that later)!

## Jobs
There are many kinds of jobs, which give you different collectables. You also gain XP and money!

## Collectable
Collect different items to get trophies! You can gain collectables by working, or buying them from the shop. Trophies grant you boosts such as XP boosts.
